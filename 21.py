# Python Program to Find the Sum of Natural Numbers
# Sum of natural numbers up to num
num = 16
if num < 0:
   print("Enter a positive number")
else:
   sum = 0
   # use while loop to iterate until zero
   while(num > 0):
       sum += num
       num -= 1
   print("The sum is", sum)
   # The sum is 136

# Write a function to find the sum of first N natural numbers.
# Hint: The formula for the sum of the first N natural numbers is N*(N+1)/2.
# For example, for input 5, the outout should be 15.
